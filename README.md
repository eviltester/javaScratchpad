javaScratchpad
==============

A personal Scratchpad used for Java Demos and  tutorials.

There are some 'canned' examples I build on and talk around for demos.

The scratchpad class might have some random 'stuff' from examples I've used in demos.

This is also a dumping ground for code examples I use on slides that are not in any other repo.
